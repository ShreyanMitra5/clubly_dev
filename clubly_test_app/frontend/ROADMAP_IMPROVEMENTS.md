  config JSONB, -- Form configuration
  events JSONB, -- Array of events
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Data Structure
```json
{
  "config": {
    "clubTopic": "Robotics",
    "schoolYearStart": "2024-08-01",
    "schoolYearEnd": "2025-05-31",
    "meetingFrequency": "weekly",
    "meetingDays": ["monday", "wednesday"],
    "meetingTime": "15:00",
    "goals": "Learn robotics fundamentals"
  },
  "events": [
    {
      "id": "meeting-1",
      "title": "Introduction to Robotics",
      "description": "Club meeting: Introduction to Robotics",

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

```bash
# Copy the contents of supabase_setup.sql and run in Supabase SQL Editor
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Ensure your Supabase environment variables are set:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### 3. Dependencies
The new UI components use these libraries:

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-progress @radix-ui/react-avatar framer-motion
```
