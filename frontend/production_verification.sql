-- 1. Check if all required tables exist
SELECT 
  'Table Status:' as check_type,
  CASE 
    WHEN COUNT(*) = 8 THEN '✅ All tables exist'
    ELSE '❌ Missing tables: ' || (8 - COUNT(*))::text
  END as status
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN (
  'teachers', 'clubs', 'advisor_requests', 'messages', 
  'notifications', 'teacher_availability', 'meeting_bookings', 'tasks'
);

-- 2. Check advisor_requests table has new columns
SELECT 
  'Advisor Requests Fields:' as check_type,
  CASE 
    WHEN column_name IS NOT NULL THEN '✅ meeting_day column exists'
    ELSE '❌ meeting_day column missing'
  END as status
FROM information_schema.columns

-- 3. Check if indexes exist for performance
SELECT 
  'Index Status:' as check_type,
  CASE 
    WHEN COUNT(*) >= 10 THEN '✅ Performance indexes created'
    ELSE '⚠️ Some indexes may be missing'
  END as status
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND indexname LIKE 'idx_%';

-- 4. Check RLS is enabled on sensitive tables
SELECT 
  'Security Status:' as check_type,
  tablename || ': ' || 
  CASE 
    WHEN rowsecurity = true THEN '✅ RLS Enabled'
    ELSE '❌ RLS Disabled'
  END as status
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('messages', 'notifications', 'teacher_availability', 'meeting_bookings');

-- 5. Check if required functions exist
SELECT 
  'Functions Status:' as check_type,
  CASE

    ELSE '❌ Missing functions'
  END as status
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_schema = 'public' 
AND routine_name IN ('update_updated_at_column', 'cleanup_old_notifications');

-- 6. Sample data validation (check if basic structure is working)
SELECT 
  'Data Validation:' as check_type,
  'Teachers: ' || COUNT(*)::text || ' records' as status
FROM teachers
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'Data Validation:' as check_type,
  'Clubs: ' || COUNT(*)::text || ' records' as status
FROM clubs
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'Data Validation:' as check_type,
  'Advisor Requests: ' || COUNT(*)::text || ' records' as status
FROM advisor_requests;

-- 7. Check for any constraint violations
SELECT 
  'Constraint Status:' as check_type,
  'No constraint violations found' as status
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.check_constraints 
  WHERE constraint_schema = 'public'
);

-- 8. Performance check - identify any slow queries (tables without indexes on foreign keys)
SELECT 
  'Performance Check:' as check_type,
  'All foreign key columns indexed' as status
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 
  FROM information_schema.table_constraints tc
  JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage kcu ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
  WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
  AND tc.table_schema = 'public'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM pg_indexes 
    WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
    AND tablename = kcu.table_name 
    AND indexdef LIKE '%' || kcu.column_name || '%'
  )
);

-- 9. Recent activity check (if there's data)
SELECT 
  'Recent Activity:' as check_type,
  'Messages in last 24h: ' || COUNT(*)::text as status
FROM messages 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'Recent Activity:' as check_type,
  'Notifications in last 24h: ' || COUNT(*)::text as status
