-- Test RLS Setup - Verify Everything is Working
-- Run this script to test your RLS configuration

-- 1. Check RLS Status
SELECT 
    '=== RLS STATUS CHECK ===' AS info;

SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,

-- 2. Check Policies
SELECT

    policyname,
    permissive,
    roles,

-- 3. Test Authentication Status

-- Try to access each table and count rows
-- If policies are working, these should return row counts
SELECT 'users' as table_name, COUNT(*) as accessible_rows FROM users

SELECT

FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';

SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_policies
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- 6. Final Status
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND rowsecurity = false) = 0 
        THEN '‚úÖ ALL TABLES HAVE RLS ENABLED'

        THEN '‚úÖ POLICIES ARE CREATED'
        ELSE '‚ùå NO POLICIES FOUND'
    END as policies_status;

-- 7. Test Insert (this will show if policies allow data modification)
SELECT 
    '=== INSERT TEST ===' AS info;

-- Try to insert a test notification (this should work if policies are correct)
INSERT INTO notifications (user_id, title, message, type) 
VALUES ('test_user_123', 'Test Notification', 'This is a test', 'test')
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

-- Check if the test record was inserted
SELECT

-- 8. Final Result
SELECT 
    '=== FINAL RESULT ===' AS info;

SELECT

        WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND rowsecurity = true) >= 16
