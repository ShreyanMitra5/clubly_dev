7. Include hands-on activities, projects, or workshops
8. Topics should directly relate to the club goals: ${clubGoals}

MEETING TOPIC FORMAT:
- Use specific, descriptive titles
- Include the main skill/concept being taught
- Mention specific tools, techniques, or projects
- Make it clear what students will accomplish
