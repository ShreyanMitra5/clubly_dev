# Advisor System Debugging Guide

## The changes ARE in the code! Here's how to see them:

### Step 1: Check the Right Location
- Go to any club page: `http://localhost:3000/clubs/[YourClubName]/`
- Click **"Advisor"** in the left sidebar navigation
- You should see the new modern UI

### Step 2: Clear Cache & Restart
If you don't see changes:
```bash
# 1. Stop your dev server (Ctrl+C)
# 2. Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next
# 3. Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Check Browser Console
Open browser dev tools and look for:
- "Checking advisor for club:" console logs
- Any JavaScript errors
- Network requests to advisor-requests API

### Step 4: Force Refresh
- Use Ctrl+F5 (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac) to hard refresh
- Try incognito/private browsing mode

### Step 5: Verify Modern UI Elements
Look for these new features:
✅ Emerald/teal gradient header with checkmark icon  
✅ "Club Advisor" title with "Your dedicated mentor for [Club]"  
✅ Modern profile card with teacher avatar  
✅ "End Relationship" button in top-right  
✅ Room, Email, Status, and Since information  
✅ "Open Messages" button with arrow animation  

### Step 6: Test Club-Specific Behavior
- Go to different clubs
- Each should have independent advisor systems
- Advisors should be club-specific, not shared

## Quick Test Commands:
```bash
# Restart dev server
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Check for TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# Check for linting issues
npm run lint
```

## If Still Having Issues:
1. Make sure you're on `/clubs/[clubName]/` and not `/clubs/[clubName]/advisor/`
2. Check that you have an approved advisor for testing
3. Run the SQL script: `frontend/update_advisor_status_options.sql`
